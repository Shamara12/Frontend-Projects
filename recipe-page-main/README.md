## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid


### What I learned

While this exercise flex my sore html and css muscles, I learnt new tricks too! Amazing tricks such as:


```css
ol li::marker{
        color: hsl(332, 51%, 32%);
        font-weight: 700;
}
```


### Continued development

I will do my best to improve my knowledge of html and css. 
- Using html tags
- Working with tables
- Linking fonts to css or html code

### Useful resources

- [W3 Schools](https://www.example.comhttps://www.w3schools.com/cssref/sel_marker.php) - This helped me break through almost every block I encountered. Their inbuilt code editor is a life saver.
- [Free Code Camp](https://www.example.comhttps://www.freecodecamp.org/) - This is an amazing resource I recommend for every beginner. 
- [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/profile/yourusername) - This provided me with practice exercises for frontend projects.
